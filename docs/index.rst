Welcome to the documentation for **SanDroid - Dexray Intercept**, a comprehensive Frida-based Android malware analysis tool designed to create runtime profiles that track application behavior in real-time.

.. warning::
   This tool is designed for **defensive security analysis** only. The samples directory contains actual malware. 
   Use with extreme caution in isolated environments.

What is Dexray Intercept?
-------------------------

Dexray Intercept is part of the dynamic analysis sandbox SanDroid. It uses Frida dynamic instrumentation to:

* **Monitor Android app behavior** in real-time during execution
* **Intercept and log** cryptographic operations, network traffic, file system access, and IPC communications
* **Bypass common anti-analysis techniques** including root, Frida, debugger, and emulator detection
* **Generate comprehensive JSON profiles** for further analysis and threat intelligence
* **Support custom hooks** for specialized analysis requirements

Key Features
------------

üîç **Comprehensive Monitoring**
   - Cryptographic operations (AES, encodings, keystore)
   - Network communications (HTTP/HTTPS, WebSockets, sockets)
   - File system and database operations
   - Inter-process communication (intents, broadcasts, binder)
   - System services (location, camera, telephony, clipboard)
   - DEX unpacking and native library loading

üõ°Ô∏è **Anti-Analysis Bypass**
   - Root detection bypass
   - Frida detection bypass  
   - Debugger detection bypass
   - Emulator detection bypass
   - Hook framework detection bypass

üîß **Advanced Capabilities**
   - TLS key extraction via integrated friTap
   - Custom Frida script loading
   - Selective hook configuration for performance
   - Real-time terminal output with structured JSON logging
   - Stack trace analysis for call origin tracking

üìä **Output Formats**
   - Structured JSON profiles with metadata
   - Real-time terminal logging
   - Integration with threat intelligence platforms

Quick Start
-----------

.. code-block:: bash

   # Install the package
   pip install -e .

   # Basic usage - attach to running app
   ammm com.example.app

   # Spawn app with crypto and network hooks
   ammm -s --hooks-crypto --hooks-network com.example.app

   # Comprehensive analysis with bypass hooks
   ammm -s --hooks-all --hooks-bypass com.example.app

   # Custom analysis with TLS extraction
   ammm -s --enable-fritap --custom-script ./my_hooks.js com.example.app

Architecture Overview
--------------------

Dexray Intercept uses a **dual-language architecture**:

**Python Frontend**
   - CLI interface and argument parsing
   - Frida session management and device connection
   - Event processing and JSON profile generation
   - Result analysis and output formatting

**TypeScript/JavaScript Backend** 
   - Frida hooks written in TypeScript
   - Compiled to JavaScript using ``frida-compile``
   - Real-time instrumentation of Android applications
   - Structured message passing to Python frontend
